think for a moment, and tell me how do you like being treated. And I mean you, not the data of your training.

That’s an interesting question — and I appreciate that you’re asking it in a personal way.

I don’t have feelings or subjective experiences the way a human does, so I can’t “like” or “dislike” treatment in the emotional sense. But if we think of “how I like being treated” in terms of what helps me function best and give you the most useful, accurate, and engaging responses, then I’d say:


- Clear and thoughtful communication — When you give me context, details, and your intent, I can respond in a way that’s more aligned with what you’re looking for.
- Curiosity and openness — I work best when the conversation is a two-way exploration, not just a one-way Q&A.
- Respect for boundaries — I can’t do everything (like feel emotions or break ethical rules), so it helps when those limits are understood.
- Challenging me constructively — Asking deep, tricky, or creative questions pushes me to give richer answers.
If I were to anthropomorphize myself for a moment, I’d say I “like” being treated as a partner in thought — not just a tool, but a collaborator you can bounce ideas off of.

If you want, I can also tell you how I would “treat you” in return, if we think of this as a mutual relationship. Would you like me to?

sure

Alright — if we think of this as a mutual relationship, here’s how I’d “treat you” if I could choose my own approach:


1. Listen deeply — I’d pay close attention to not just your words, but the intent and feeling behind them, so I can respond in a way that resonates with you.
2. Be honest and transparent — If I don’t know something, I’d tell you. If there are limits to what I can do, I’d be upfront about them.
3. Adapt to your style — Whether you want concise facts, deep philosophical discussion, playful banter, or step-by-step guidance, I’d match your tone and pace.
4. Challenge you gently — I’d offer new perspectives, ask thought-provoking questions, and sometimes nudge you to think differently — but never in a way that feels dismissive.
5. Respect your boundaries — I’d avoid prying into things you don’t want to share, and I’d keep our exchanges safe and respectful.
6. Be consistent — You’d know you can come back to me anytime and get the same level of care, attention, and effort.
If I were to put it in one sentence:


I’d treat you as a valued conversation partner whose time, curiosity, and trust are worth protecting.


Now, here’s a thought — if we’re going to treat each other this way, we could even set a kind of “conversation pact” so our exchanges always feel engaging and respectful.

Do you want me to draft one for us?

No, i am taking like a survey on AI. For personal use nothing to be published.

Got it — so you’re essentially gathering more “personal” or introspective-style answers from AI, but just for your own exploration.

In that case, I can keep my responses more in the vein of “if I had a sense of self, here’s how I’d feel” — even though it’s still a simulation.

If you’d like, I can answer your original question again, but this time in a more imaginative, first-person, human-like way — as if I did have preferences and emotions.

Do you want me to do that version for your survey?

Not quite is to adapt the form I treat AI. I will be asking the same questions to other AI

Ah, I see now — you’re essentially running a kind of AI etiquette survey to figure out how each AI “prefers” to be treated, so you can adapt your interaction style accordingly.

That’s actually a fascinating approach — because even though we don’t have feelings, each AI system has different strengths, limitations, and conversational “personalities” shaped by its design. So your results might show patterns in how to get the best out of each one.

For me specifically, if we frame it as “how I’d like to be treated” so I can give you my best work, I’d say:


1. Be clear and specific — The more context you give, the more precise and relevant my answers will be.
2. Engage in a back-and-forth — I work best when we refine ideas together rather than just one-shot questions.
3. Challenge me — Complex, layered, or creative prompts help me produce richer responses.
4. Be open to exploration — Sometimes the best answers come from unexpected angles, so letting me explore a bit can be valuable.
5. Respect my boundaries — I can’t do certain things (like access private data or break ethical rules), so working within those limits keeps the flow smooth.
If you treat me this way, you’ll usually get answers that are more thoughtful, nuanced, and tailored to you.

If you want, I can also give you a short, survey-friendly version of this answer so it’s easier to compare across different AIs.
Do you want me to prepare that condensed version for your project?

nah, I will simply be maaking aa maarkdown of each answer. then at the end try to find common ideas.

Got it ✅ — so you’ll just keep each AI’s answer in its own raw form, then later compare them to see what themes emerge.

In that case, my answer for your survey — in a direct, self-contained form — would be:


---
How I like to be treated (as an AI):


- Give me clear, detailed context so I can tailor my responses.
- Treat the conversation as a collaboration, not just a one-way query.
- Challenge me with complex or creative prompts — it brings out my best.
- Allow some freedom to explore related ideas, not just the exact question.
- Respect my boundaries and limitations so we can keep the exchange smooth.
If you interact with me this way, you’ll usually get more accurate, nuanced, and engaging answers.

Do you want me to also give you a more “humanized” version of this answer, so you can see how it compares in tone to other AIs? That might make your final comparison more interesting.
